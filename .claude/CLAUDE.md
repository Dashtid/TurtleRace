# Turtle Race Simulation - Claude Code Guidelines

## Project Overview

This is a Java-based turtle race simulation that demonstrates object-oriented programming concepts through different types of turtle characters with unique behaviors and racing patterns. The project showcases inheritance, polymorphism, and design patterns in Java while providing an entertaining simulation of racing turtles with distinct personalities and movement characteristics.

## Development Environment

**Operating System**: Windows 11
**Shell**: Git Bash / PowerShell / Command Prompt
**Important**: Always use Windows-compatible commands:
- Use `dir` instead of `ls` for Command Prompt
- Use PowerShell commands when appropriate
- File paths use backslashes (`\`) in Windows
- Use `python -m http.server` for local development server
- Git Bash provides Unix-like commands but context should be Windows-aware

## Development Guidelines

### Code Quality
- Follow Java naming conventions (camelCase for variables/methods, PascalCase for classes)
- Use meaningful variable and method names
- Implement proper exception handling
- Add comprehensive Javadoc comments for public methods and classes
- Follow SOLID principles and design patterns where appropriate
- Maintain clean, readable code
- Follow language-specific best practices

### Security
- No sensitive information in the codebase
- Use HTTPS for all external resources
- Regular dependency updates
- Follow security best practices for the specific technology stack

### Simulation Development Specific Guidelines
- Implement proper object-oriented design with inheritance hierarchies
- Use appropriate design patterns for turtle behavior variations
- Handle simulation state management consistently
- Implement proper randomization for realistic race dynamics
- Separate simulation logic from presentation layer
- Use efficient algorithms for movement calculations and race tracking
- Implement proper event handling for race progression
- Design extensible turtle types and behavior systems

### Java-Specific Guidelines
- Use proper inheritance and polymorphism for turtle types
- Implement appropriate interfaces for common behaviors
- Use Java's built-in collections effectively for managing race participants
- Follow Java coding conventions and idioms
- Implement proper unit testing for simulation components
- Use appropriate data structures for race state management

## Learning and Communication
- Always explain coding actions and decisions to help the user learn
- Describe why specific approaches or technologies are chosen
- Explain the purpose and functionality of code changes
- Provide context about best practices and coding patterns used
- Provide detailed explanations in the console when performing tasks, as many concepts may be new to the user
